This repository implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for pathfinding in a grid world with obstacles. The graphical representation of the grid world and the path is achieved using the `tkinter` library.

## Features
- Random generation of obstacles in the grid.
- Visualization of the pathfinding process using ACO.
- A button to generate new obstacles and re-run the ACO pathfinding.

## Prerequisites
To run the code, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the `numpy` and `tkinter` libraries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script.
3. A window will pop up showing the grid world. Click on the "Generate Obstacles" button to randomly generate obstacles and visualize the pathfinding using ACO.
4. If a path from the start to the end is not found due to the obstacles, a message "Path blocked. Please try again." will be displayed in the console.

## Code Structure

- `generate_obstacles(world, num_obstacles)`: Generates random obstacles in the grid.
- `ACO`: A class implementing the ACO algorithm.
    - `choose_direction(ant_pos, visited)`: Determines the direction an ant should move based on the pheromone levels and the heuristic.
    - `find_path()`: Allows an ant to find a path from the start to the end.
    - `simulate_ants(num_iterations)`: Simulates the movement of multiple ants and updates the pheromone levels.
    - `draw_world(canvas, world, path)`: Draws the grid world, obstacles, and the path on the canvas.
- `generate_new_obstacles()`: Generates new obstacles, runs the ACO algorithm, and updates the visual representation.
